# 404-Page
Interactive 404 page created using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. It features a parallax background that moves with the mouse cursor, this was achieved using jQuery. The purpose of this project was to create an nicer looking 404 page. I have a lot of projects that use "dead links" that lead to nowhere. Instead of leading to those ugly 404 pages I figured why not create one. I have plans to add a moving gradient background to this that changes color and removing the parallax.
